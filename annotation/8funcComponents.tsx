// Annotating a function component
// This is exactly the same as annotating a function, just with a bit different output.

// In your index.jsx file go ahead and delete your App Component so you have the following left:
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";

ReactDom.render(<App color="red" />, document.querySelector("#root"));

// Lets make a simple functional component:
const App = () => {};
// Lets annotate it! Looking back at '2functions.ts' we see we need to define out inputs and output.
// Because we're passing in props this will be similar to before. All we need to do is create an interface above our Component:
interface AppProps {
  color?: string;
}
// Go ahead and annotate your props argument as follows:
const App = (props: AppProps) => {};

// This function is now assumedly going to output some JSX Elements to the html, so lets annotate it as such.
const App = (props: AppProps): JSX.Element => {};
// By default, React & Typescript both have an interface built in for the JSX namespace,
// so you don't have to define your own interface. (You can Command & click on JSX to see it yourself)
// Perfect, you should see an error because the Component isn't outputting any JSX like it's been defined to, so let's add an output
const App = (props: AppProps): JSX.Element => {
  return <div>{props.color}</div>;
};
