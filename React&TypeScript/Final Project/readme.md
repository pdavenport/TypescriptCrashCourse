## Final Project

For the final project, I'd like you to take your React 201 Giphy project and implement Typescript in your `app.js/jsx` file.
The first thing you'll need to do is make sure your type definitions are up to date by running:

```c
npm install @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Secondly, for TypeScript to work correctly, you need to rename your `.js` file to a `.ts` file, or if you have JSX, rename your `.jsx` file to a `.tsx` file.
The main thing I'd like you to focus on is taking your App component, make sure you're using the constructor method, and
creating an interface for your App State and App Props(if applicable).
Try to have as few `any` type definitions as possible and no errors.
